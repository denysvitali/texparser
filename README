This code is highly experimental and still under construction. It
comes with no guarantees, no warranties and is not future-proof.

PURPOSE
=======

My Java application MakeJmlrBookGUI needs to parse LaTeX files so
that it can fix common problems. This mainly involves replacing
obsolete/problematic code and removing ".eps" from included graphics, 
so that the book correctly compiles with pdflatex and my jmlrbook class.
Since TeX4HT no longer works with my jmlrbook class, I started to
extend the TeX parsing code so that it could convert the article
abstracts to HTML without requiring TeX4HT.

Since I have another Java application that also needs to parse LaTeX
files (datatooltk), I decided to split away the TeX parsing code
into a separate library, namely texparserlib.jar. At the moment,
texparserapp.jar is just provided to test the texparserlib.jar code,
but I may develop it into an application for replacing obsolete
LaTeX code. texparserapp currently only works in batch mode.

Syntax:

texparserapp --in <tex file> --output <out dir>

This parses <tex file> and saves the new file in <out dir> and
copies over any included images. It will run epstopdf on any eps
files and wmf2eps on any wps files. Both epstopdf and wmf2eps must
be on your system path.

The output directory <out dir> must not exist. This is a
precautionary measure to ensure you don't accidentally overwrite the
original files.


TEST FILES
==========


Test files are in src/tests/

EXAMPLES
========

Example 1:
_________

The test file src/tests/test-obsolete/test-obs.tex contains obsolete
commands such as \bf, \centerline and \epsfig.

cd src/tests
texparserapp --in test-obsolete/test-obs.tex --output output/test-obsolete

This will create the directory output/test-obsolete and create a
file in it called test-obs.tex which is the original file with the
obsolete commands replaced. The eps file is also copied over to the
new directory and epstopdf is used to create a corresponding pdf
file. The \epsfig command is converted to \includegraphics with the
file extension removed.

Font changing commands, such as \bf, are changed to the
corresponding LaTeX2e font declarations (such as \bfseries) in text mode
and the corresponding LaTeX2e math font commands (such as \mathbf)
in math mode. The commands are unchanged if they occur in the
argument of \verb or in a command definition.

Example 2:
_________

The test file src/tests/test-sw/test-sw.tex simulates output from
Scientific Word. (I don't have SW so I can't test this. The code is
based on the type of code I've had to work with as a production
editor.) In general I don't want commands such as \bigskip in the
articles, as the inter-paragraph spacing should be dependent on the 
book style. Also, I don't have tcilatex.tex used by SW, so
texparserapp removes \input{tcilatex} and substitutes \FRAME and
\Qcb. I don't know what other commands tcilatex defines. Those two
are the only ones I've encountered so far. texparserapp also
replaces \special{language "Scientific Word";...;tempfilename
'imgname.wmf'} with \includegraphics{imgname} and runs wmf2eps on
the wmf image.

cd src/tests
texparserap --in test-sw/test-sw.tex --output output/test-sw

This creates the directory output/test-sw and writes a copy of
test-sw.tex with the relevant substitutions. The image file
X0001.wmf is converted to eps and the eps file is then converted to
pdf.

Example 3:
_________

Conversion to HTML just creates a single HTML file.
It's very limited as currently I only need to convert
abstracts to HTML. Images aren't supported. MathJax is used to 
render math mode.

cd src/tests
texparserapp --in test-article/test-article.tex --output output/test-article --html
